                        <h3>Where The Journey Began...</h3>
                    At an ealry age as an adolesecent, my father 
                    taught me not to view physical work as a chore,
                    but to embrace it as exercise, which vital to human
                    health. He would always tell me this whenever I 
                    didn't want to do phyical chores. So as I began to 
                    get older, I began to challenge myself in fun ways 
                    doing chores and this helped me challenge myself in 
                    different ways. My family owned a convenience store 
                    and one way I would challenge myself, would be to see
                    how many heavy grocery boxes I could lift in as little 
                    of time as possible without getting tired and doing it 
                    in the correct way my was taught. My father would say 
                    "make sure you're lifting with your legs and not you 
                    back son!". As the years progressed and I got older, 
                    I then began enjoying physical labor, and it was no 
                    longer "as a pain in the rear" as it was earlier. My 
                    journey into fitness was just beginning to take shape.

                        <h3>The Adventure</h3>
                    My passion for fitness began early on when I was in my early 20's.
                    In my early 20's I got my first gym membership at Bally's Total Fitness.
                    I would always see commercials on television and how nice the equipement 
                    was and how everyone in the commercial looked really cool exercising, and I
                    began to envision myself in the same light as those who were on the TV 
                    commercials. The gym was located in the Clayton area on the street called Forsyth.
                    Fitness was so important to me, I would essentially put the rest of my life on
                    hold, if I had't exercised for that day. I can remember, making friends of mine 
                    wait untill AFTER I'd workout, before we would go out and have a night on the town.
                    Friends and I thinking back to that period of time, makes us laugh till this very day.
                    I religously exercised and it began to rub off on my close friends to the point, they
                    all joined BTF and got more into fitness as well.

                        <h3>At The Cross Road</h3>
                    The more I got into fitness, the more my body began to change and take shape into a more
                    atheletic pyhsique, the more I had a healhty addiction to exercise and over the years began
                    to incorporate nutrition also into what I was doing. Fast forward from my 20's to my 30'
                    and my journey brought me to a whole new world and level of fitness, Natural Body Building.
                    I remembered someone I knew from my days working out at Bally's, who was employed there as one 
                    of the lead personal trainers. I'd heard that he'd opened up his own fitness studio and at this
                    time I'd wanted to take my fitness to the next level and become more toned. So I visited his 
                    studio to sit with him and have him customize a nutritional plan to help me shed a few extra pounds.
                    Hoever, after we talked, before I knew it I'd signed up to have him train me to compete in my very 
                    first natural body building competition.

                        <h3>Test Of Self</h3>
                    Needless to say, I really didn't fully understand the magnitude of what I had just signed up to do. I
                    THOUGHT I would simply have to change the way I was eating, and simply continue to work out the way I
                    became accustomed to working. Boy was I wrong! Just imagine, from a nutritional standpoint, taking your 
                    current lifestyle of eating, and completely stripping away everything you love to eat, for a total of 3 to
                    to 4 months. That means no sugar, no alcohol (if you enjoy that), non of your favorite pizza, ice cream,
                    everything that you've become to enjoy. As far as exercising, imagine doing the most strenious and hardest 
                    exercise you've ever done, and multiply that times 100! This by far was the most grueling challenge I've taken
                    in my entire life, physically and most of all mentally! But nothing in life worth while costs you very little.
                    The cost was very high physically and mentally pushing me past limits I thought I could never achieve and much
                    more! However, all of the anguish and pain I went through in my training, definitely paid off in the end!

                        <h3>Victory</h3>
                    My very first body building competiton, in the novice category, I won 1st place in my height class. The joy I felt
                    in winning 1st place, for my very FIRST show, was undescribable. All of my hard work paind off! All of the days and
                    nights where I questioned myself "why am I doing this", "why am I putting myself through so much pain" was realized
                    when I was handed that 1st place trophy! I went on to compete in two more shows in what's called the "Open Category"
                    in which competitors compete for the opportunity to gain a "Pro Card" which allows a competitor to compete in Natural
                    Body Building on a professional level for all kinds of different prizes, prize monies, and national recognition. So in
                    my second competition, in the open category, I won 3rd place, which was a very tough competition. For my third competition,
                    competing again in the open category, I won 5th place, again another tough category. I'm not one to make excuses, however
                    in this particular competition, my body was in the best shape its every been amongst the shows I competed in, however I used
                    a tanning solution without testing it before hand. This made my muscles look soft or "washed out", as it's called in the BB
                    community, so I beleive, had I not done that, I could have taken a higher placing than what I was awarded. But, as they say
                    Proper Preperation Prevets Poor Performance (the 4 P's)!

                        <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                    Here are a few photo's from the various shows I've competed in. Thank you for taking time to read about my fitness journey and
                    sharing in this journey with me. I could not have done any of this without my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and as 1st John 4:4
                    says...&quot;Greater is He who is in me, than he who is in the world.&quot; Take Care.
